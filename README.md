FindDefault (Prediction of Credit Card Fraud)

Credit card fraud is a serious issue, and detecting it promptly can save customers from unauthorized charges. This project aims to build a classification model to predict fraudulent credit card transactions.

The dataset used contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. It includes 284,807 transactions, of which only 492 are fraudulent (0.172%), making the data highly imbalanced.

This project focuses on:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),
Handling imbalanced data,
Feature engineering,
Model selection, training, validation, and deployment.

--Predictive Model: Classifies transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
--Comprehensive Pipeline: Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
--Imbalanced Data Handling: Employs resampling techniques to address class imbalance.
--End-to-End Documentation: Clear instructions for installation, usage, and deployment.
The dataset for this project can be accessed via the link provided in the repository:
File: creditcard.csv

Dataset Highlights:-
--Transactions: 284,807
--Frauds: 492 (0.172%)

Features:
--Time: Time elapsed since the first transaction.
--V1–V28: PCA-transformed features.
--Amount: Transaction amount.
--Class: Target variable (0 = legitimate, 1 = Frauds).

## Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing:-

--Data quality checks.
--Handling missing values and outliers.
--Correcting data types (e.g., time as datetime).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
--Visualizations to understand data patterns.
--Statistical summaries of key features.

3. Imbalanced Data Handling:=
Techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or undersampling to balance the dataset.

4. Feature Engineering
--Creating and transforming features for improved model performance.
--Selecting the most relevant features using statistical and machine learning techniques.

5. Model Selection
--Experimenting with models like:
--Logistic Regression
--Random Forest
--Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
--Support Vector Machines
--Choosing the best-performing model.

6. Model Training and Validation
--Splitting data into training and testing sets.
--Evaluating model performance using metrics like:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
ROC-AUC

7. Hyperparameter Tuning
Using grid search or random search to optimize model parameters.

8. Deployment Plan
Creating a plan for integrating the model into a production environment.
